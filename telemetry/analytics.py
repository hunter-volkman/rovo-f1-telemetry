def lap_delta():
    """
    Experimental helper for calculating alternative lap delta metrics.

    Intended ideas:
        - Compare each lap against a rolling baseline instead of best lap only.
        - Explore different smoothing windows for noisy telemetry data.

    NOTE:
        This function is experimental and may be revised or removed.
