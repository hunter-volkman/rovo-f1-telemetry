    Compute basic per-driver performance metrics for a race session.

    Intended outputs:
        - Best lap time per driver
        - Average lap time per driver
        - Simple consistency metrics (for example, lap time variance)

    TODO:
        - Implement the actual aggregation on top of normalized lap data.
        - Decide on the final return type (DataFrame or typed object).
